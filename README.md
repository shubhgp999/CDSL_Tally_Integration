# CDSL_Tally_Integration
Project: Tally Automation – Voucher Import & Ledger Creation
1. Overview

A Java Spring Boot middleware that automates voucher import and ledger creation in Tally using XML-based APIs.
I built this solution end-to-end — requirement breakdown, development, testing, and deployment.

2. Problem

Manual voucher entry was slow, error-prone, and inconsistent across teams.

3. Solution

Automated voucher import

Auto-creation of missing ledgers

XML transformation engine

Logging, validation & retries

Clean API layer to integrate with any external system

4. Architecture

(You can drop a simple diagram, or bullets)

Source API → Middleware → XML Transformer → Tally API → Response Parser

5. Tech Stack

Java • Spring Boot • XML • Tally APIs • Postman • JSON

6. Your Role

Handled 100% of the project: design + coding + testing + UAT + deployment.

7. Impact

90% manual effort reduced

Consistent ledger creation

Faster onboarding for new clients

Reusable internal module
